# Jetpack Compose MVVM Playground

Welcome to my Jetpack Compose MVVM Playground! ðŸš€

## About
This app is built entirely in Kotlin, with the user interface crafted using Jetpack Compose. It's my personal project aimed at mastering the basics and fundamentals of Jetpack Compose. Throughout its development, I've focused on creating practical components that you can use in your everyday app development tasks. Feel free to explore the codebase and learn alongside me!

## Features
In addition to Jetpack Compose components, this app also includes Dependency Injection (DI) implementation for Retrofit. It fetches data from an API stored in a JSON bin. The API provides tweets categorized by topics, each with its corresponding text.

Here's a glimpse of what you'll find:

1. **Bottom Sheets**: Enhance your app's user experience with sleek and functional bottom sheets.
2. **Coil Library**: Effortlessly load and display images with the power of the Coil library.
3. **Floating Action Buttons**: Add interactive elements to your app with floating action buttons.
4. **Alert Dialogs**: Keep users informed and engaged with intuitive alert dialogs.
5. **Bottom Nav Bar**: Simplify app navigation with a customizable bottom navigation bar.
6. **Grid List using Lazy VerticalGrid**: Organize your content beautifully with a grid layout.

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to expand the app's functionality and add even more exciting features!

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute! ðŸŒŸ
